 Understand the problem:
    1. Restate the problem in your own words?
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    4. Can the Outputs be determined from the inputs?
    5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem

 Explore Concrete Examples
    1. Start with simple examples.
    2. Progress to more complex examples. 
    3. Explore examples with empty inputs.
    4. Explore inputs with invalid inputs.
    
 Break it down:
    1. Write down the steps(commenting)
    2. Start with the pseudo code.
    3. Minimize the problem.
    
 solve/simplify (Solve the Problem, if you can't solve simpler problem):
    1. Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do.
    2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    3. Write a simplified solution.
    4. Then incorporate that difficulty back in.
    
 Look back and refactor:
    1. Can you chack the result?
    2. Can you derive the result differently?
    3. Can you understand it at a glance?
    4. Can use the result or method for some other problem?
    5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?4
    6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    7. How have other people solved this problem?
